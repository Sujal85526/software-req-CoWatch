- **As Priya, I want instant free login** so username/password → "Welcome back! My Rooms" without subscriptions or Google OAuth.
- **As logged-in Priya, I want 1-click room creation** so paste a YouTube URL → auto-generate `/rooms/abc123` → copy WhatsApp-ready link in <10 seconds.
- **As Priya, I want a "My Rooms" dashboard** to see named rooms (e.g., "K-drama Night #5") and filter by date/active, avoiding unrelated content.
- **As Rohan (friend, no account), I want shared `/rooms/abc123`** so click a link and the YouTube loads at the exact timestamp (no login barrier).
- **As any participant, I want real-time chat** so messages and emoji appear instantly during playback without refresh.
- **As Priya (owner), I want master playback controls** so her play/pause/seek actions sync all participants instantly.
- **As Priya, I want mid-session URL update** so swap a link (e.g., proxy) without recreating the room or re-sharing the link.
- **As Priya post-binge, I want 1-click room delete** so rooms can be removed from "My Rooms" easily.
- **As Priya, I want an online user list** to see who is joined, watching, or chat-only.
